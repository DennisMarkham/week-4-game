This program is a game.  It does not fully function yet.  Ideally, the user has 10 tries to guess the letter the computer is 
"thinking of."  The user does this by pressing a key.  Each incorrect guess is logged.  If the user does not guess correctly in ten tries, 
a loss is added to his/her tally, the incorrect letter guesses are cleared, and the computer thinks of a new letter.  If the user guesses 
correctly, the computer generates a new number, the incorrect letter guesses are cleared, and a win is added to his/her tally.
